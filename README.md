# elasticsearch-node-rotation

This [AWS Step Function](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) is used to rotate the nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster, 
without interrupting the availability of data.

It is designed so that node rotations can be scheduled frequently, in order to regularly update the underlying AMI 
(Amazon Machine Image) of each EC2 instance. We use this tool in combination with [AMIgo](https://github.com/guardian/amigo) 
(for baking AMIs) and [Riff-Raff](https://github.com/guardian/riff-raff) (for updating the AMI associated with an AutoScaling 
Group).

## Assumptions

The project assumes that each Elasticsearch node is running on a dedicated EC2 instance, which is part of an 
ASG (AutoScaling Group).

## Setting up node rotations for an Elasticsearch cluster

1. Ensure that all EC2 instances are running the [AWS SSM agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html). 
1. Create an S3 bucket (or choose an existing one), to store SSM command output. This is only required temporarily, so you may wish to 
[configure object expiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-expire-general-considerations.html) for this bucket.
1. Ensure that all EC2 instances have the [required permissions](#aws-permissions).
1. Create a new Cloudformation stack, using the [template](https://github.com/guardian/elasticsearch-node-rotation/blob/main/cloudformation.yaml)
in this project. The frequency of node rotations is passed into the template as a parameter.
1. Add `RotateWithElasticsearchNodeRotation: true` as a tag the AutoScaling groups containing the instances that will be rotated
1. Update the AMI associated with your AutoScaling Groups on a regular basis (using Riff-Raff's scheduled deploy feature).


### Running Manually
Sometimes it's useful to rotate an ES node manually (e.g. during an ES upgrade), you can optionally pass a `targetInstanceId` in the step function input object. It's usually easiest to open an existing execution and click `New Execution` then just edit the input object. 

### Rotating nodes into a new ASG

Very occasionally, it is required to migrate a cluster into a new Autoscaling Group. To do this with the node rotation step function by:

1. Follow the setup steps above.
1. Create the new ASG with DesiredCapacity set to 0.
1. Set the MinimumCapacity of the old ASG to 0.
1. Tag the new ASG with `gu:riffraff:new-asg = True`. (This is the tag that is already used by riff-raff for identifying the newer ASG during migrations).
1. Run as normal, either manually or letting the schedule rotate the instances.

The step function will detect and launch new instances in the new ASG, while removing nodes from the old ASG.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature has been developed and tested for Elasticsearch clusters which exist in a single ASG, and the "new" ASG can be
> matched to the "old" one using Stage/Stack/App tags. If your usecase doesn't match this, you'll likely need to do some more testing
> and possibly improve this feature. If you're at all unsure, get in touch in the Elasticsearch chat space and we can figure out
> any potential issues together.


## Implementation

This Step Function triggers a number of TypeScript lambdas, which coordinate the process of replacing a node by:

* Performing various sanity checks and identifying a node to rotate
* Adding a new node into the cluster
* Migrating all data from the target node onto the new node (if data is present)
* Shutting down Elasticsearch on the empty node
* Terminating the unused EC2 instance

In order to ensure that the new EC2 instance is brought up in the same Availablity Zone as the target EC2 instance, 
the target instance is [detached](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/detach-instance-asg.html) from its ASG
during the node rotation process.

In order to move all data off the target EC2 instance, the node is excluded from 
[shard allocation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/allocation-filtering.html). 
Shard [rebalancing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/shards-allocation.html#_shard_rebalancing_settings)
is temporarily disabled during the rotation process, to prevent Elasticsearch from moving shards unnecessarily.

## AWS Permissions

This Step Function requires a number of IAM permissions in order to control the number of running EC2 instances 
and run commands against Elasticsearch nodes (which is achieved via SSM's EC2 Run Command). Full details of the permissions
required can be found in this project's Cloudformation [template](https://github.com/guardian/elasticsearch-node-rotation/blob/main/cloudformation.yaml)

The EC2 instances (which are subject to rotation) will require the following IAM permissions in order to handle incoming SSM commands: 

```
Statement:
- Effect: Allow
  Action:
  - ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage
  - ec2messages:DeleteMessage
  - ec2messages:FailMessage
  - ec2messages:GetEndpoint
  - ec2messages:GetMessages
  - ec2messages:SendReply
  - ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation
  - ssm:ListInstanceAssociations
  - ssm:DescribeInstanceProperties
  - ssm:DescribeDocumentParameters
  Resource: "*"
- Effect: Allow
  Action:
  - s3:PutObject
  Resource:
  - arn:aws:s3:::<your_bucket_name_here>/*
```

Contributing and Testing Changes
---------------------------------

This project is deployed to multiple AWS accounts. Consequently, you should ensure that a node rotation can still be performed successfully before merging any changes to `main`.

Unfortunately, there is no pre-production environment available for testing changes. Consequently, we recommend using Riff-Raff to deploy your branch to an individual account in order to validate your changes in production. If in doubt, testing changes against the ELK stack (in the Deploy Tools account) is a good place to start. 

In order to do this, select `Preview` from the deployment page (instead of `Deploy Now`). Next `Deselect all` and then manually select all deployment tasks for a specific account. Once youâ€™ve done this you can `Preview with selections`, check the list of tasks and then `Deploy`.

Once you have confirmed that the change works as expected, the PR can be merged. This will automatically roll the change out across several AWS accounts via Riff-Raff. Please also inform the Investigations & Reporting team, as [they use a different deployment mechanism and will need to pick up the change manually](https://github.com/guardian/elasticsearch-node-rotation/blob/66b2640bdbf006e887edfd3467c662d0c7c4756b/riff-raff.yaml#L87).

If the change adds or removes a feature, significantly alters AWS resources or is considered to be especially risky, you might also want to inform the teams who own the affected AWS accounts via Chat/email.
